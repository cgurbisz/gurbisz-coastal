Two students working in my lab on their senior research St. Mary's Projects (SMPs) presented posters at the Spring 2019 Atlantic Estuarine Research Society (AERS) meeting at the George Mason University Potomac Science Center in Woodbridge, VA. Kajsa Newton presented her analysis of coastal marsh and forest dynamics in Chesapeake Bay, and Dylan Powell discussed the results of his field investigation into non-destructive measures of marsh plant biomass in the wetlands located on campus. They did an excellent job and received excellent feedback from the always supportive AERS community.
