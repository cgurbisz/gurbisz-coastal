abstract: "This article features two engaging high school activities that include current scientific information, data, and authentic case studies. The activities address the physical, biological, and chemical processes that are associated with oxygen-depleted areas, or “dead zones,” in aquatic systems. Students can explore these dead zones through both hands-on investigations and interdisciplinary critical-thinking exercises."
