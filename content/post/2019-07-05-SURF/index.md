Colleen McGuire, a student researcher funded by SMCM's St. Mary's Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program, just wrapped up her summer fieldwork. She has been investigating the extent to which a restored oyster reef just off the campus shoreline improves water clarity. Because SAV need clear water to grow, and oysters can clear the water, she hypothesizes that oyster restoration could potentially enhance SAV restoration. Our goal for this research is to explore whether further research into desigining oyster restoration plans to facilitate SAV restoration is feasible.  Colleen presented her preliminary findings at the SURF symposium on July 3, 2019. She will continue her research with additional fieldwork in September and writing throughout the 2019-2020 academic year for her St. Mary's Project.
