We just completed our last day of field sampling for our [SAV beds as nutrient sinks project](https://gurbisz-coastal-ecology.netlify.com/project/2019-sav-nutrient-sediment-sink/sav-nutrient-sediment-sink/). It was a gorgeous, calm day and the SAV at Susquehanna Flats seemed to be doing fine, even after all the flooding that occurred on the Susquehanna River last year. We're still processing samples and will begin to really dig into the data this fall. My collaborator Cindy Palinkas, her graduate student Miles Bolton, and I will all be presenting a portion of the project at the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation biennial conference in Mobile Alabama this November.
