Cassie Gurbisz was quoted in an article that was recently published in the Chesapeake Bay Journal. The article, titled [*Scientists fear steep loss of Bay grasses lies ahead*](https://www.bayjournal.com/article/scientists_fear_steep_loss_of_bay_grasses_lies_ahead), discusses how Chesapeake Bay SAV is doing this year after major flooding flushed tons of nutrients and sediment into the bay last year. Dr. Gurbisz mentions in the article how grass coverage at some of our field sites seemed to be patchier this year compared to last, like in the video below. We're still analyzing the data, so it's hard to say for sure whether there was a real decrease.

By and large, however, the Flats are doing well. The latest [aerial SAV monitoring photos](http://web.vims.edu/bio/sav/maps.html) show that SAV throughout much of the upper Bay is still abundant. It's likely a different story in the mid and lower bay, where more salt-loving species don't form dense canopies extending to the water surface like the freshwater SAV growing at the Flats. The Viriginia Institute of Marine Science folks are still analyzing the aerial photos, so the official SAV abundance numbers have not yet been released.
