abstract: "The Learning Science through Research program enhanced middle and high school science education by linking it with state-of-the-art research through a two-part program. The program’s professional development workshops for secondary science teachers provided background information on ocean sciences and related research through a 3-day summer workshop and a 1-day workshop, which directly addressed the student research experience. The program’s second component, the student lessons, included pre-and post-trip classroom activities and a field trip to our research facility. This research experience provided students with the opportunity to conduct experiments using first-rate instrumentation and technology. The program engaged over 2500 students in the process of inquiry by conducting research activities related to locally relevant coastal ocean environmental problems."
