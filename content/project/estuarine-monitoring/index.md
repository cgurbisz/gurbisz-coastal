In 2022 we began (or I should say revived) a monitoring program from the SMCM dock which I hope will remain a long-term effort. My Coastal Ecosystem Ecology class, student research assistants, and St. Mary's Project students have been measuring basic water quality parameters, like light, temperature, pH, and nutrient, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll concentrations. They are also conducting periodic ecosystem metabolism experiments and deploying data loggers. We are currently working on a data portal to visualize monitoring results in a publicly accessible, easy to interpret format. Stay tuned for updates!
