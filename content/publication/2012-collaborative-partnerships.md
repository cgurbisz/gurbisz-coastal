abstract: "Scientists talk to scientists and educators talk to educators, but seldom do the two camps interact in a collaborative fashion. This gap between science and education results in poor student achieve-ment and a general lack of interest in sciences. To address the gap, we developed a model for partnering scientists, educators, and students in a 6 week research-education collaboration, designed to provide meaningful communication between science and education spheres. Our program involved a team of participants who worked together to learn from one another and to convey research concerning coastal ocean systems through developing an education module—complete with background information about the research topic, lesson plans with student projects, and video logs—based on the science. Evaluation studies of the partnership program showed successful outcomes for both research scientists and educators. In addition, the project developed effective education materials that communicated complex research topics to both formal and informal audiences. Our hope is that this model of focused interaction between scientists, students, and educators to produce educational materials can serve as a guide to those interested in generating educational materials involving other topics in the geosciences."
