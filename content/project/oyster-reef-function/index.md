Creating artificial oyster reefs is a resource-intensive method of oyster restoration compared to "seeding" the bottom with natural shell and oyster spat. But the 3-D structure may provide greater ecological benefit compared to relatively low-relief shell on bottom reefs. In this series of senior research projects, SMCM students are investigating whether oyster reef height enhances oyster growth and how the restored reef affects physical and biogeochemical properties such as wave energy and water quality.
