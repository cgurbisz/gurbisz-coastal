The [St. Mary's Undergraduate Research Fellowship](https://sites.google.com/smcm.edu/surf-smcm/home?authuser=0) (SURF) program provides funding for SMCM students to conduct intensive summer research on campus with a faculty mentor. SURF fellows and mentors meet weekly to discuss the research process and research progress. At the conclusion of the program, students present their work in a public forum. Many SURF fellows apply their summer research to their St. Mary's Projects the following academic year. The following students have completed SURF projects in the Coastal Ecosystem Ecology Lab.
