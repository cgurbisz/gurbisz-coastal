Gurbisz Lab senior research students presented their St. Mary's Projects (SMPs) at St. Mary's College of Maryland this week. Five students presented posters on a diverse range of topics at the student research symposium. Isaac Page studied shorebird phenology, Dylan Powell worked on developing methods for local non-destructive marsh vegetation sampling, Kajsa Newton analyzed coastal forest and marsh landscape dynamics, Chelsea English investigated sediment trapping in SAV beds, and Tyler Scott measured sediment accretion rates in a local marsh. Isaac Hersh showed a documentary film on wetland conservation that he created with his collaborator Keven Glotfelty, a Theater, Film, and Media Studies major.
