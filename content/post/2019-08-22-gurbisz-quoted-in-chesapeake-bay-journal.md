Cassie Gurbisz was quoted in an article that was recently published in the Chesapeake Bay Journal. The article discussed how Chesapeake Bay SAV is doing this year after major flooding flushed tons of nutrients and sediment into the bay last year. Dr. Gurbisz mentions in the article how grass coverage at some of our field sites seemed to be patchier this year compared to last. We're still analyzing the data, so it's hard to say for sure whether there was a real decrease. By and large, however, the Flats are doing well. The latest aerial survey photos show that SAV throughout much of the upper Bay is still abundant. It's likely a different story in the mid and lower bay, where the more salt-loving species don't form such dense canopies extending to the water surface. The Viriginia Institute of Marine Science folks are still analyzing the aerial photos, so the official SAV abundance numbers have not yet been released.
