Exciting news! The National Academy of Sciences awarded the [Cozzarelli Prize](http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/pnas-cozzarelli-2018.html) to a reseach group that I'm a part of. The award recognizes a [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/14/3658) titled, "Long-term nutrient reductions lead to the unprecedented recovery of a temperate coastal region" that we recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It was the product of a data synthesis working group in which I participated that was funded by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program. We showed that reductions in nitrogen pollution led to widespread recovery of submersed aquatic vegetation in the Chesapeake Bay. What an honor to work with such a diverse and talented group of scientists!
