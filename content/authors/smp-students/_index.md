Most SMCM seniors complete a capstone research project, known at SMCM as the [St. Mary's Project](http://www.smcm.edu/academics/st-marys-projects/), or SMP. The SMP is a two-semester independent research endeavor that students conduct under the mentorship of SMCM faculty. At the end of the second semester, students submit a written report and present their work in a public forum. Everyone presents at the SMCM student research symposium, and some students additionally give presentations at professional conferences. The following students have completed or are currently working on their SMPs in the Coastal Ecosystem Ecology Lab.
